## Dead Reckoning Project (2018.06 ~ 2018.09)
Loss in GPS data happens when the vehicle passes by a high building, on bridges, at turnnel, and in suburb areas. 

GPS is one of very important features for both the company and clients, since it brings geographical information that explains where they have been around.

The analysis on other perfect data but worse gps data, it cannot be served to a client.

Therefore, maintainning in perfect gps data is needed.



Dead Reckoing is one of famous algorithms that discover how the gps data explores.

and three supported algorithms to build are as follows:

### Three ways to build
1. `complimentary filter`
2. `kalman filter`
3. `Ramer-Douglas-Peucker`

These three algorithms are built as seen in the scratch code flows, and deployed them on the system.

The reason to use three different algorithms all is that, again, gps data is needed to be perfect itself, thusl; complementary strategy
